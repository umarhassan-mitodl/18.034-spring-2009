[18.03 OCW, Spring 2010](/courses/18-03-differential-equations-spring-2010)

18.03 on OCW contains lecture notes, assignments, and a full set of video lectures. They complement nicely what we do in 18.034. In particular, those who would like to do some straightforward problems of solving Differential Equations may find them useful the homework assignments of 18.03.

[d'IAMP Applets ("Mathlets")](http://math.mit.edu/daimp/)

We will employ a series of specially written Javaâ„¢ Applets, or demonstrations during lecture and recitation.
